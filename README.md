# Hi, I'm <YOUR_NAME> 👋

I’m exploring Web3 development: smart contracts, Ethereum tooling, and small practical experiments.

## What I’m focusing on now
- Solidity basics: storage, events, mappings, access control
- Ethers.js scripts: read data from chain, simple wallet interactions
- Clean repos: readable READMEs, small demos, notes

## Featured repos
- 📒 web3-notes — my learning notes & cheat sheets
- 🔐 solidity-basics — tiny contracts (Storage/Counter) + explanations
- ⚙️ ethers-scripts — small scripts with ethers.js

## Tech stack (beginner-friendly)
- Solidity, JavaScript/TypeScript (basics)
- Ethers.js, Hardhat (learning)
- GitHub Actions (later)
