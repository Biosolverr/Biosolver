# Hi, I'm Biosolver 👋

Coding is my hobby — I tinker with Web3 stuff for fun: small smart contracts, simple scripts, and learning notes as I go.

## What I’m doing right now
- Learning Solidity fundamentals (storage, events, mappings, basic access control)
- Writing small Ethers.js scripts (read on-chain data, simple wallet interactions)
- Keeping things tidy: short demos, readable READMEs, and practical notes

## Featured repos
- 📒 **web3-notes** — my learning notes & cheat sheets
- 🔐 **solidity-basics** — tiny contracts (Storage/Counter) with explanations
- ⚙️ **ethers-scripts** — small scripts using ethers.js

## Tech I play with
- Solidity
- JavaScript / TypeScript (basics)
- Ethers.js, Hardhat (learning-by-doing)
